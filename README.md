# Overview
There are three main functions in this project:object detection, distance measurement and information screening.
We achieved :
  object detection through darkflow: https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow.git
  distance measurement with ZED Stereo Camera
  information screening by myself. LOL
Here's to record every steps I did in this project. And because I am still a green hand in this field, I will appreciate for any kinds of advice.
